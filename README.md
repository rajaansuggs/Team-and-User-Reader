# Team-and-User-Reader
This Team and User Reader Utility demonstrates the reading in and parsing of User and Team data from three tab delimited files. Subsequently, I've used HashMaps and ArrayList to store the User objects, Team objects and User_Team objects. Keep calm, relax and soak in this lovely code!
